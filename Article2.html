        <h3>1. Lough Dan, Co Wicklow</h3>
            <p>This is a favourite of ours and a great little spot a stroll and a swim. The boomerang-shaped ribbon lake is a bit of an adventure hub. You’ll inevitably run into climbers, SUPers, fellow hikers and kayakers ambling around this spot. You have to hike through some private lands but walkers are allowed, just remember to leave no trace. It’s about a 4km hike down to the secluded beach. Don’t be put off by the brown hue of the water, wade in and unwind!</p>

        <h3>2. Graiguenamanagh to St Mullins, Co Kilkenny</h3>
            <p>The Barrow Way is a beautiful 120km long distance walk along the riverbanks of the Barrow. It follows surviving towpaths and riverside roads, from Lowtown in Co Kildare to the idyllic little village of St Mullins in Co Carlow. The peaceful route winds its way through the sylvan landscape following the river. Our favourite section is Graiguenamanagh to St Mullins. It’s 7km one way and there are umpteen spots along the bank that are perfect for a wild dip.</p>

        <h3>3. Raven Point Wood, Co Wexford</h3>
            <p>Park up at the Raven Wood car park and explore the beautiful woodland walkway before emerging out onto the stunning white sandy beach of Curracloe for a swim. The waymarked walk is 7km long. The fields to the west are the North Slob lands, home to many important species of birds. If you are doing this walk during the winter months, you might spot all the geese from the North Slob flying out to roost on sandbanks in Wexford Harbour. The beautiful blue flag beach at Curracloe is definitely the highlight of this beach walk.</p>

        <h3>4. Bray to Greystones, Co Wicklow</h3>
            <p>The Bray to Greystones Cliff Walk is about seven kilometres long and brings you right around the outside of Bray Head. The walk is mostly flat with a few hills along the way. It is suitable for all abilities. You will arrive in the seaside village of Greystones. Here there are a number of cafes and restaurants should you want to refuel before your hike back along the same route. If you don’t want to walk back you can get the Dart from Greystones back to Bray. It will take about 3-4 hours there and back. Whichever direction you choose to go, there is a beach at either end waiting for you to take the plunge.

        <h3>5. Coumshingaun Lake, Comeragh Mountains, Co Waterford</h3>
            <p>Just type in Coumshingaun Lake into Instagram and the pictures alone will have you hopping in the car and heading straight there – all with the goal of nabbing yourself that epic picture of you perched on a rock overlooking the famous corrie lake. The hike to the lake is not waymarked so if your navigation skills are weak, we recommend hiring Mario from Muddy Boots. This guide’s stories of life in the Comeraghs and the hermit of Lackendarra will leave you spellbound. He’ll also introduce you to lots of edible plants as you walk. Getting up to the lake and back down takes about two hours. The highlight is definitely shedding your inhibitions and diving into the refreshing waters of this stunning lake.</p>

        <h3>6. Peddlers Lake, Co Kerry</h3>
            <p><strong>Don’t depend on your smartphone!</strong></p>
            <p>There are so many beautiful beaches to take a dip in along the Kerry coastline including Ballybunion, Inch and Derrynane. For something a little more adventurous though, up near the top of Dingle’s Conor pass, you’ll find an idyllic little lake called Peddlers Lake. It’s a bit of a climb up to reach it and the water will be chilly… but wow, what a view. There is nothing quite like swimming in the mountains.</p>

        <h3>7. Do I need walking poles for hiking?</h3> 
            <p><strong>Walking poles can be nice to have - </strong>especially if you have dickey knees – but are a personal preference. Some people swear by them and won’t go hiking without them, but others don’t use them at all.</p>

        <h3>8. Leave no trace</h3> 
            <p><strong>If you carry it in, you carry it out.</strong>Hill walkers should abide by the ‘Leave no trace’ ethic when out adventuring. Dispose of your waste properly by taking home all litter, food and even fruit peels and other biodegradable foods. Also, bring home toilet paper and even tea bags.</p>
            <p><strong>Going to the toilet outdoors, learn the rules.</strong> For number ones, make sure you’re well away from streams. And if you’re caught out and must do a number two, you should dig a small hole at least 15-20cm deep at least 30m from water or the trail, and cover it when you’re finished.</p>
            <p><strong>Leave what you find behind</strong>Leave gates as you find them, whether open or closed, and also leave plants, rocks, flowers and even fallen trees as you found them.</p>
            </div>
            
        <div class = "post__entry">
        <h3>9. Find out the weather forecast</h3> 
            <p><strong>Check the weather forecast</strong> so you know if it’s a good day to head up into the hills, as high winds and cold temperatures will be far more extreme the higher you are.</p>
            <p><strong>Don’t forget to check dusk times</strong> so you know when it’s going to get dark. It’s advised to finish your hike well in advance of dusk.</p>
            <p><strong>Tell someone where you’re going </strong>and when you’ll be back.</p>

        <h3>10. Join a walking group or hiking club</h3> 
            <p><strong>Join your local walking club, such as the Limerick Free Hiking Club on MeetUp (press on image below).</strong></p>
            <p>Hill walking is a great social activity and is a lovely way to meet new people. The other advantage of joining a group is so that you can get some guidance and benefit from the group’s experience — and they’ll likely have loads of ideas of beautiful hikes in your area. The Get Ireland Walking website is a good source of walking groups throughout the country. We regularly list hiking festivals in our events section and Mountaineering Ireland also has a list of events on its website so you can see what’s on.</p>

        <h3>11. Emergency contacts</h3> 
            <p><strong>In the case of emergency</strong>and if you need assistance, call 999 or 112 and ask for mountain rescue. Emergency calls (999/112) use any network available to your phone, not just the one you’re on, so you should be able to make an emergency call if your phone has no coverage.</p> 
            <p><strong>Don’t forget to check dusk times</strong> so you know when it’s going to get dark. It’s advised to finish your hike well in advance of dusk.</p>
