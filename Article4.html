            <p>This looped walk really packs a punch when it comes to spectacular views.

        <h3>6. Sheep’s Head Way, Co Cork</h3>
            <p><strong>Distance: 88km (lots of shorter loops available)</strong> </p>
            <p><strong>Time:  3 days in entirety</strong></p>

            <p>The Sheep’s Head Way is an 88km circular walking route beginning in the town of Bantry in Co Cork and running out along the north coast of the peninsula to the scenic lighthouse at the very tip before returning along the south side, passing through the pretty villages of Kilcrohane, Ahakista and Durrus.</p>
            
            <img src="img/art52.PNG" alt="" />
            
            <p>The terrain is varied and includes old boreens, open grassy and hearty moorland, field paths, quiet country roads and some short stretches of woodland paths. The remains of an old copper mine, a blowhole, stone circles, standing stones, high cliffs, a Napoleonic signal tower and old churches are some of the varied attractions to be discovered along the way. You might even be lucky enough to spot dolphins and whales off the westernmost tip of the headland.</p>
            
            <p>If 88km seems a little too taxing for you, there are a number of shorter looped walks available. These walks include the Caher Loop (5.4km), the Lighthouse Loop (4km), the Moyny Bridge Walk (2.5k), the Kealkill Loop (11.5km) and the Glounaclohy Walk (9.5km).</p>

                     
            <p><strong>Re-fuel:</strong> The Gateway in Durrus Village is a quaint café that will perfectly compliment a lovely day had on on Sheep’s Head Way. With great coffee, piping hot tea, baked goods and sandwiches, there is something for everyone. The Old Creamery in Kilcrohane and the Heron Gallery and Cafe in Ahakista are also well worth a visit.</p>
